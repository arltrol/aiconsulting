<h1>💡 AI on a Shoestring: How Small Charities and SMEs Can Start Without Big Budgets</h1>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> February 2025</p>
<p>Think AI is only for tech giants and deep-pocketed enterprises? Think again. In 2025, powerful AI tools are finally within reach of small businesses and charities — even those on a tight budget.</p>

<h2>Why Budget Shouldn’t Stop You</h2>
<p>Thanks to platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, and open-source automation tools, even micro-organizations can automate repetitive tasks, improve communications, and boost productivity. You don't need a data scientist or a six-figure budget — just the right tools and a smart strategy.</p>

<h2>Free & Low-Cost AI Tools That Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ChatGPT Free / Plus (£20/mo)</strong>: For writing, summarizing, and content generation</li>
  <li><strong>Zapier Free Plan</strong>: Automate basic workflows</li>
  <li><strong>Canva AI Tools</strong>: Design and generate social media graphics</li>
  <li><strong>Otter.ai Free</strong>: Transcribe meetings and interviews</li>
  <li><strong>Tally.so</strong>: Build AI-enhanced forms for surveys or grant intake</li>
</ul>

<h2>Start Small: Where to Begin</h2>
<p>Don’t try to ‘AI everything’. Start with one process that drains time: maybe donor outreach, volunteer onboarding, or monthly reporting. Then use free tools to automate just that.</p>
