    <p>AI Agents — not just chatbots, but intelligent, goal-driven assistants — are no longer theoretical. They're arriving now, and they’re about to reshape how we work, especially for resource-stretched organisations like charities and small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>

    <h3>🤖 What Is an AI Agent?</h3>
    <p>Think beyond ChatGPT. An AI agent can take instructions like “apply for five relevant grants this month” or “summarise all new leads from our CRM” and execute them without constant human prompting. These agents combine tools like GPT-4, web automation, APIs, and memory to act semi-independently.</p>

    <h3>🌍 Why This Matters to Charities and SMEs</h3>
    <p>For teams with 2–20 people trying to do the work of 50, AI agents are a game-changer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 Draft donor reports, funding proposals, or newsletters automatically</li>
      <li>📅 Monitor funding portals or sales sites and take action based on triggers</li>
      <li>📧 Send personalised outreach emails, then summarise replies</li>
      <li>📊 Generate board reports or funding metrics without touching Excel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It’s like hiring a full-time assistant who works 24/7 — for the cost of a few coffees a month.</p>

    <h3>⚠️ But There Are Pitfalls</h3>
    <p>Without proper setup, AI agents can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Send incorrect or inappropriate messages</li>
      <li>Violate GDPR or donor confidentiality</li>
      <li>Waste time chasing the wrong goals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The key is deploying the right level of autonomy, with ethical guardrails, and only in workflows that are clearly defined.</p>

    <h3>✅ How We Help You Deploy AI Agents Safely</h3>
    <p>At Your AI Consultant, we don’t just give you a chatbot and walk away. We help you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify high-leverage use cases for AI agents in your org</li>
      <li>Set up safe, auditable, and effective workflows</li>
      <li>Train your team and monitor outcomes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether you want to automate a few repetitive tasks or explore a full-time virtual assistant, we’ll help you deploy smartly — not blindly.</p>
