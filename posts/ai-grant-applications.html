<h1>✍️ How to Automate Grant Applications: AI Writing Tools That Actually Work</h1>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> April 2025</p>
<p>Grant writing is one of the most time-consuming tasks for charities. But now, AI tools can help you generate drafts, improve tone, and highlight key metrics — saving hours while boosting your chances of success.</p>

<h2>Tools to Try</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ChatGPT Plus or Claude.ai</strong>: Use them to generate first drafts of grant responses based on past successful applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Grammarly with AI</strong>: Instantly improve tone, clarity, and structure.</li>
  <li><strong>Notion AI</strong>: Turn research and notes into polished sections</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grant Templates You Can Reuse</h2>
<p>Create a prompt library (like we do in our <a href="/posts/ai-readiness-audit.html">AI Readiness Audits</a>) to re-use structure and language across grants — adapting as needed.</p>

<h2>Want This Done for You?</h2>
