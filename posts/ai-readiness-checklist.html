<p>Before you invest in AI tools or consultants, it’s worth taking a moment to understand where you stand. Use this quick checklist to see if your SME or charity is ready to take the leap.</p>

<h2>✔️ AI Readiness Self-Check</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do you have time-consuming, repetitive tasks?</li>
  <li>Are you using spreadsheets to track operations or donor activity?</li>
  <li>Do staff often complain about “manual work”?</li>
  <li>Are key processes undocumented or in someone’s head?</li>
  <li>Do you already use tools like Google Docs, Notion, or Slack?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you answered “yes” to 3 or more — you’re ready to explore automation.</p>
